## Execution :rocket:

Run the simple.py (current main file) on a shell/terminal

**`> python [python3] main.py`**





## Plans :house:

* Create a GUI for the game
* A better interface (OOP) ✔
* Hopefully, an AI based play

> I know its much but I'll learn all the how tos and will update it in future! :blush:
